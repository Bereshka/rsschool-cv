## About me

Originally, I am from Ukraine, but since 2013 I have lived in the USA, Texas,  Houston. There I started <a href="bereshkaweb.net">BereshkaWeb</a> which develops websites, SEO, Google advertising, content management, and other services related to digital marketing. Most of the sites presented in the portfolio were created by me. I work with such platforms as WordPress, Joomla, Wix, Shopify, and others. I also offer clients SEO and Google Ads. In 2020 I moved to Greece, Athens where I still live. Among other services are hosting, photography, and videography.
